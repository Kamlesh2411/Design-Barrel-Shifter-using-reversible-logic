# Design-Barrel-Shifter-using-reversible-logic
This is my Course Project of Digital Design Subject, 
Here in this Project i have used Feyman & R-mux reversible Gate's and write a code for reversible Barrel Shifter in Verilog Language.

This project highlights the implementation of an 8-bit Barrel Shifter using reversible logic, showcasing its efficiency compared to traditional designs. 
The work demonstrates how reversible gates, such as Feyman and R-mux gates, can be applied in practical scenarios. With growing importance in quantum computing and nanotechnology,
reversible logic is set to play a pivotal role in future computing paradigms. This project serves as a foundational step toward energy-efficient and sustainable computing systems.
Reversible logic is a way of designing digital circuits where every input can be uniquely determined from the output, meaning no information is lost during the computation. 
Unlike traditional logic, which often erases some data (causing energy loss as heat), reversible logic preserves all data, making it energy-efficient.
This is especially useful for low-power applications and technologies like quantum computing, where energy and data preservation are critical.
