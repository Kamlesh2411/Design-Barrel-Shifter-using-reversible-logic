# Design-Barrel-Shifter-using-reversible-logic
This is my Course Project of Digital Design Subject, 
Here in this Project i have used Feyman & R-mux reversible Gate's and write a code for reversible Barrel Shifter in Verilog Language.

Project Name:
8-Bit Barrel Shifter Using Reversible Logic

Problem Statement:
Design an energy-efficient Barrel Shifter, reducing energy loss compared to traditional designs.

How I Solved It / Logic:
Used reversible logic gates like Feyman and R-mux to implement the shifter, ensuring no data loss and improved efficiency.

Which Technology I Used:
Implemented using Verilog HDL and reversible logic, aligning with energy-efficient computing needs and advancements in quantum technology.
